### Notes
The greatest challenges were debugging the various small issues that they were showing up and trying to determine how one thing previously done impacted something later down the line. The ability to create a collection view and be able to operate different types of navigations was really interesting to learn and I can imagine would be extremely useful for iOS development. I appreciate learning the things that are especially relevant to industry and most common practices or uses, as the instructor noted.

### Notes

This project served as a platform to learn Xcode and Swift/Objective C on a more fundamental level, because that's not something I've had much exposure to. It was also interesting to be exposed to and work with storyboards and various user interface elements. Flix also gave me a stronger understanding of how different components of an iOS application come together and I felt that I was able to get a solid foundation in the implementation of table views, API utilization, and auto layout configuration.
